ROCK PAPER SCISSORS

Play against a computer AI in Rock Paper Scissors, 2/16/2017

By Chad Durkin and Lawrence Eby

Description

This application will allow the user to play against a self learning computer in rock paper scissors, The more you play against the computer the better it gets! There is a sense of randomness as well because the algorithm used isn't set to always pick the most commonly used move when it won, it has a chance to randomly choose 1 of the 3 moves, if not, it rolls into the array of moves recorded when won, so every time you lose, the computer adds the move it won with into an array of other winning moves, and it randomly chooses out of there, making it so you can't break it by choosing the same move over and over again.
